<center><h1>Fairness-Aware Continuous Learning (FACL)</h1></center>

This repository provides an implementation of fairness-aware regularization for
notions of fairness based on (conditional) independence. This code was used to
run the experiments of the paper:
> Fairness-Aware Learning for Continuous Attributes and Treatments, J. Mary,
C. Calauz√®nes, N. El Karoui, ICML 2019

## Install

First, you can create two conda environments from the YML files, one for the library facl only and one for library and 
notebooks. If you wish to run the examples, you should choose 'env_library_and_notebooks.yml'.
```bash
conda env create -f env_library_and_notebooks.yml
conda activate continuous-fairness-all
```

## Examples

You can find several examples of use in the directory `examples` in the form of
jupyter notebooks.
